# Email Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

Users were encountering an error when completing orders:
```
MongoDB save error: Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted
```

This was happening because:
1. The order creation process required email notifications to succeed
2. Email authentication was failing due to incorrect SMTP credentials
3. The error from email sending was causing the entire order process to fail

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Made Email Sending Optional
- Modified `sendEmail` utility to return errors instead of throwing them
- Added configuration checks to skip email if not properly configured
- Made email sending non-blocking for core business logic

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Updated order controller to use non-blocking Promise calls for emails
- Added proper error handling for all email operations
- Prevented email errors from interfering with order creation

### 3. Updated Configuration
- Created `.env.example` with clear documentation for email settings
- Added timeout parameters to prevent hanging connections
- Added secure option toggle for different SMTP configurations

## How to Configure Email

To enable email notifications, update your `.env` file with the following:

```
# Email configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password-here  # For Gmail, use App Password
```

For Gmail specifically:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an "App Password" for your application
3. Use this App Password instead of your regular Gmail password

## Testing

1. With invalid email credentials: Orders will still be created successfully in MongoDB
2. With valid email credentials: Orders will be created and emails will be sent
3. Without email configuration: Orders will be created and email sending will be skipped

The system now gracefully handles email errors without affecting the core order functionality.
